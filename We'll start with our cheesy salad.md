Today we're going to make 4 delicious smoothie bowls for a healthy and filling breakfast option But before we get into the recipes, let's quickly understand what a smoothie bowl is It's a thick and creamy shake made by blending different fruits, almond milk and dry fruits which we can enjoy by adding different toppings to it Honestly, it tastes like ice cream but without sugar, artificial colours, cream or milk First, we'll make a flavour-rich saffron pistachio smoothie bowl which tastes just like Kulfi Then we'll make Instagram-perfect, the most beautiful, jamun smoothie bowl Then we'll make a granola-filled caramel smoothie bowl and finally, my personal favourite, a Rasila Mango smoothie bowl made with just 3 ingredients Before we get into the recipes, let's quickly discuss how frequently you should eat smoothies If you're in the healing stage, then once a week is enough, not more than that because they're a little heavy If you're in the lifestyle stage and don't have any health issues, then you can have them 2-3 times a week Kids and athletes can have them daily, no problem In this video, all the recipes are served to one person Let's start with our saffron pistachio smoothie bowl To make most of the smoothie bowls, we need frozen bananas For this, it's very important to use ripe bananas What are the signs of ripe bananas? They have small dots on them Most bananas we buy from the market are not ripe enough If you keep them in a closed cupboard for a few days, they will ripen and have dots on them Then, you can simply cut the banana into 5 parts and put them in a plate and keep them in the freezer for 4-6 hours You might be thinking why are we using a freezer while we are doing a heart-wrenching heart attack? So that your smoothie bowl can have a thick and creamy texture Along with this, we need 1/4th tsp saffron threads which we have soaked in 1 tbsp hot water By soaking saffron in hot water for a while, its flavour will come out even more Now, add 2 frozen bananas, 10 pistachios soaked in water for 6 hours, 1/3 cup fresh coconut milk, we've given the recipe in our other video, which we've left the link in the description below 1 tbsp jaggery powder, 2 dates, seeds removed, and for flavour, Â½ tsp cardamom powder Add saffron threads soaked in water along with the water and a pinch of rock salt Now just mix everything together and blend everything well There, your smoothie is ready! Take it out in a bowl Do you know what the most fun part of making smoothies is? To make the toppings! On top of this, we'll add 1 tbsp roasted and crushed pistachios, 1 tbsp roasted and crushed almonds, 1 tsp dried rose petals, and for garnishing, 3-4 saffron strands Whenever you feel like making something special for your friends and family, this is the perfect option They won't even know that they're eating smoothie or dessert Now it's time for our next smoothie bowl But whenever I make this smoothie bowl, I spend half an hour clicking pictures of it This is our vibrant and colourful Jamun smoothie bowl To make this, we need around half a kilo of Jamun Be careful to buy these thick, dark-coloured Jamun, as they're sweet Now with the help of a knife, separate the seeds from the Jamun and transfer the pulp into a bowl I believe that this smoothie bowl it takes a little more time We usually make this when friends, family or guests visit us Then we put all the seeds in a mixer jar, 2 frozen bananas, 10 soaked almonds, 3 dates, and finally 1/2 cup water Blend everything until you get a deep, jammy colour Tadaaa! Your vibrant, beautiful smoothie bowl is ready! You can add any fruit, nuts or seeds you like I'll add these beautiful yellow mangoes and some seeds Now let's move on to our third smoothie bowl - the caramel smoothie bowl When I tasted this smoothie bowl for the first time, I felt like I was eating caramel ice cream Take a medium jar of a blender and add 5 cashews, 5 almonds and 3 walnuts We soaked these 3 for 6 hours It's very important to soak the nuts before using them Then add 1 cup of water 1 tsp of jaggery powder, 3 dates, seeds removed, and for flavour, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon powder 1/4 tsp of rock salt, 1/3 cup of water, and then mix it all Then add 2 frozen bananas and mix it again And here's your tasty and creamy caramel smoothie bowl But in this recipe, the real taste will be added by our homemade crunchy granola To make it, place a tawa on low flame and add 1 tbsp of raisins, 1 tsp of watermelon seeds, 1 tsp of sunflower seeds and 1 tsp of chia seeds Now roast these for 2-3 mins on low heat Make sure they don't burn or else they'll taste bitter Now our granola is ready Now take the smoothie out into a bowl and add your granola and your favourite fruits We're adding chiku and banana to this Let's move on to our last, everyone's favourite summer special, mango smoothie bowl made with sweet mangoes This is the easiest recipe out of the four smoothie bowls For this, you'll need a big mango or two medium sized mangoes My personal favourite is Alfonso mango The aroma of mango is a different experience, right? Let the mango cool down in the fridge for 20 minutes Remember to keep it in the fridge, not in the freezer When your mangoes cool down, peel them and cut them into pieces While cutting the mangoes, Don't stop until your clothes get dirty and your hands are full of mango juice! Oh, I was just joking! Then take a blender and add 10 soaked almonds and 1/4 cup water Then add the chopped mango and blend it once more This is your cool, refreshing mango smoothie Take it out in a bowl and top it with your favourite fruits If you want, you can take these smoothie bowls out for a tiffin You can take them to office with you Before ending this video, we want to share a very special announcement with you Satvic Food Book 2 is finally available for you In this book, you'll find satvic momos, satvic pizza, dahi vada, special salads, special vegetables, rabri and even satvic cakes recipes For the past 6 months, our team and I have been working on this book and you can click the link in the description box below and order it That's all for now.
