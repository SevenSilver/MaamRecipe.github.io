So come, let’s prepare some of your favourite recipes
First we’ll prepare a very tasty, crunchy and flavour-packed Paapdi Chaat
First, we’ll prepare the paapdi. Take 1 cup flour and mix ½ cup water to it
Then add ½ teaspoon roasted cumin and ½ teaspoon rock salt and mix it well again
Then you can start rolling the mixture into thin sheets using a rolling pin
The thinner you roll them, the crispier the paapdi will be
Use a small round bowl to cut out small round paapdis from it,
and use a fork to make holes in them so that the paapdis don’t fill up with air
Then pre-heat your oven setting the temperature at 260 degrees centigrade
Now place your paapdis inside to bake them
It will take approximately 10 mins to bake them at 260 degrees centigrade
Remember, as soon as the paapdis turns light brown, take them out of the oven
The paapdis can be baked very quickly and might end up burning if you’re not careful
Next, we’ll learn how to prepare tamarind chutney. Take 1 cup tamarind pulp
To prepare this, we soaked tamarinds in hot water for 3 hours and squeezed it to turn into a pulp
2 cup dates. We had soaked them in hot water as well
Remember to remove the seeds from the tamarinds and dates before adding them to the blender
Now add ½ cup water, 14 black pepper balls, 4 cardamom, ½ teaspoon roasted cumin powder and ½ teaspoon rock salt
Blend these ingredients well and now your tamarind chutney is ready!
Now it’s time to season your peanut curd
You can add a little bit of black salt and some roasted cumin powder to it. Mix it well
Let’s assemble our Paapdi Chaat now!
Take a few paapdis in a plate
First add your seasoned peanut curd to it, then some green chutney,
then some tamarind chutney, boiled potatoes, some sprouts – like alfalfa sprouts
some pomegranates and chopped coriander. Now your delicious paapdi chaat is ready!
When you feed your guests, they’ll never be able to guess that you prepared it without dairy curd
Now, let’s see how to prepare our favourite Punjabi Kadhi
Take a blender and add 1 cup peanut curd, 4 tablespoons gram flour, 2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
Blend them well until you get a smooth mixture
Now keep a clay pot on the stove and add 1 teaspoon black mustard,
1 green chilli, 12 curry leaves, and 1 teaspoon grated ginger
Roast these spices for a while and add your blended mixture slowly to it
See that it doesn’t start lumping. Add water as needed to dilute it and stir it for 30 mins, until the curry is cooked
Once you have finished cooking it, switch off the gas and add 4 tablespoons of lemon juice and 2 teaspoons of rock salt
Now your delicious curry is ready!
Enjoy it with brown rice, you can use peanut curd to recreate your favourite recipes
But maybe you’re all wondering – “Isn’t peanut curd very expensive?”
Come, let’s clear this through our final benefit of peanut curd
The 3rd benefit of peanut curd – Peanut curd is almost half the price of dairy curd
Today, the maximum price of a 1 kg packet of peanuts is around Rs. 200
To prepare 400 gm peanut curd, we have used only 100 gm peanuts, which means only Rs. 20
On the other hand, the 400 gm packaged dairy curd we find in the markets today costs almost Rs. 40
That means peanut curd is almost half the rate of dairy curd!
